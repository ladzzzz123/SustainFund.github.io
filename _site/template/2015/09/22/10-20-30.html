    <p>We don’t like wasting much if any time on business plans; we don’t care for wasting a lot of time on startup pitches either.  Neither a good business plan or a great pitch is going to be THE key to successful business, but it can be useful to organize one’s thoughts about a business to present ideas roughly in the format that others are expecting … it’s sort of like people expect a professional speaker to introduce what he’s going to tell them, then tell them in detail and then summarize them what he’s told them.</p>

<p>The following is a template blatantly plagiarized from Guy Kawasaki’s approach to the 10-20-30 startup pitch.  It can be expanded into a business plan [if that becomes necessary].</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Insert 30-second elevator speech here and so that people know whether or not to read/listen to the rest of your presentation – do not try to appeal to everyone; appeal ONLY to those who can help you.</p>

<h2 id="need-for-productservice">Need For Product/Service</h2>

<p>What problem does this product/service solve better than anyone else? Describe your vision for how you have re-conceived of the customer use-case and why anyone will absolutely <strong>NEED</strong> YOUR product or service as soon as they find out your solution is available … if no one needs your product or service, move on to working on something that people simply cannot do without any longer.</p>

<h2 id="target-clients-or-customers">Target Clients or Customers</h2>

<p>Exactly WHO is the target?  Explain your vision for this re-conceived target customer or client.</p>

<h2 id="technology-and-methodology">Technology and Methodology</h2>

<p>What is the technology behind the product?  What is the methodology for producing the product?</p>

<h2 id="industry-analysis">Industry Analysis</h2>

<p>Demonstrate that you have thoroughly developed a network that extends throughout your industry?</p>

<h2 id="leadership-advantage">Leadership Advantage</h2>

<p>Beyond just your secret sauce, what is your leadership advantage in this space?</p>

<h2 id="marketing-plan">Marketing Plan</h2>

<p>How do you use different avenues, primarily taking advantage of the Hootsuite platform to tell its STORY.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing wrong with a CEO who can sell, but if he actually looks like a salesman, he’s probably bad at sales and worse at tech.”  Peter Thiel and Blake Masters (2014-09-16). Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future.</p>

<h2 id="management-analysis">Management Analysis</h2>

<p>Every single day we ask ourselves the seven key questions that every business must answer:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Timing</strong> Is NOW the right time to research OR plan OR develop OR launch OR scale OR pivot OR shelve your particular business idea?</li>
  <li><strong>Engineering</strong> What is the breakthrough technology or methodology you have created beyond just incremental improvements?</li>
  <li><strong>Monopoly</strong> Are you starting with a big share of a small market?  How can you change your idea to be the ONLY good alternative?</li>
  <li><strong>People</strong> Do you have the right team?  How can you get a better team?  How will you develop your team to always be the best?</li>
  <li><strong>Distribution</strong> Do you have a way to not just create but produce, deliver, distribute, evangelize your product?</li>
  <li><strong>Durability</strong> How will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future? How will you defend your position?</li>
  <li><strong>Secret</strong> Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?  What is the secret to how you found your secret?</li>
</ul>

<p>The answers change a bit every single day.  The management task for each day is basically a matter of working through the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats related to each of these seven big questions.</p>

<h2 id="financial-analysis">Financial Analysis</h2>

<p>This business cash flows, but why should investors invest?  Maybe they shouldn’t … finding investors is not necessarily the point, but financial analysis should convince others of the sustainability of the enterprise.</p>

<h2 id="summarycall-to-action">Summary—Call to Action</h2>

<p>Solid businesses continually simplify and sharpening the focus their entire business by enlisting the support of key people who can advance the cause.</p>
