The following is template for Guy Kawasaki's 10-20-30 startup pitch.  It can be expanded into a business plan.  
## Introduction

Insert 30-second elevator speech here and so that people know whether or not to read/listen to the rest of your presentation -- do not try to appeal to everyone; appeal ONLY to those who can help you.

## Need For Product/Service

What problem does this product/service solve better than anyone else? Describe the use-case and why anyone **needs** YOUR product or service?  

## Target Clients or Customers

Exactly WHO is the target?

## Technology and Methodology

What is the technology behind the product?  What is the methodology for producing the product?

## Industry Analysis

Demonstrate that you have thoroughly developed a network that extends throughout your industry?  

## Leadership Advantage

Beyond just your secret sauce, what is your leadership advantage in this space?

## Marketing Plan

How do you use different avenues, primarily taking advantage of the Hootsuite platform to tell its STORY.

"There’s nothing wrong with a CEO who can sell, but if he actually looks like a salesman, he’s probably bad at sales and worse at tech.”  Peter Thiel and Blake Masters (2014-09-16). Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future.

## Management Analysis

Every single day we ask ourselves the seven key questions that every business must answer:

- **Timing** Is NOW the right time to research OR plan OR develop OR launch OR scale OR pivot OR shelve your particular business idea?
- **Engineering** What is the breakthrough technology or methodology you have created beyond just incremental improvements?
- **Monopoly** Are you starting with a big share of a small market?  How can you change your idea to be the ONLY good alternative?
- **People** Do you have the right team?  How can you get a better team?  How will you develop your team to always be the best?
- **Distribution** Do you have a way to not just create but produce, deliver, distribute, evangelize your product?
- **Durability** How will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future? How will you defend your position?
- **Secret** Have you identified a unique opportunity that others don’t see?  What is the secret to how you found your secret?

The answers change a bit every single day.  The management task for each day is basically a matter of working through the Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats related to each of these seven big questions.

## Financial Analysis

This business cash flows, but why should investors invest?  Maybe they shouldn’t … finding investors is not necessarily the point, but financial analysis should convince others of the sustainability of the enterprise.

## Summary—Call to Action

Solid businesses continually simplify and sharpening the focus their entire business by enlisting the support of key people who can advance the cause.
