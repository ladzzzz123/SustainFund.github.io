# Introduction
Sustain Fund is contemplating a major new project that aims to encourage more startup thinking.  The working title for for this project is Sustain Fund Fellows Project.  We do NOT need people to encourage us with platitudes like "... really like your project, expecting great things, best of luck!"  We are also NOT looking for money or any offers for any kind of material support -- even if we ultimately seek partners and collaborators, it is way too early for that!  At this point, what we NEED are questions and criticisms ... especially criticisms, but we also welcome questions that provide feedback and indicate need for greater clarity and focus.

# Encourage Shrewd, Hard-Nosed Startup Thinking

We would like to see a healthier, more vibrant startup ecosystem all over the globe.  

The data on startup activity could not be more clear -- startups provide ALL new jobs and ALL new wealth creation.  Startups are disruptive and constantly threaten the position of established companies; the tendency of established companies in all industries to move in the direction of consolidation, risk avoidance and monopolistic stifling of new technologies, means that means that startups either are, directly or indirectly, responsible for ALL new innovations.

Good intentions don't matter.  Specifically, incubators and accelerators generally FAIL to really encourage more meaningful startup activity ... they may result in too many resources being devoted to weak startups doomed to failure.  Accelerators and incubators may facilitate and enable people to consider starting a new business who shouldn't do so.  Entrepreneurial experience tells us startups never be successful, unless when they are started by people who will not quit, will overcome all kinds of obstacles and simply will not take "No!" for an answer.  

Paradoxically [or maybe it's not that much of a paradox], making startup formation easier actually is contrary to encouraging startup thinking.

# Venture Philanthropy
We believe we are called to genuine kindness, empathy and serving others.  Sustain Fund believes that checkbook charity is idiot compassion or conscience laundering or *just* PR.  We experiment with different things; we fail wisely, most things don't work, we keep trying, we attempt to design smarter experiments so that we can put more effort, resources and capital into what works.

Practically, this means that we aggressively make loans and back different entrepreneurial projects around the world. It is mostly a matter of trying pour gas on fires that have been kindled. It is not just about financial capital -- increasingly, it is about community and mindshare. We try to add value to development communities by evaluating applications, writing and debugging code, forking repos and attempt to understand the application realms to better make improvements, better contribute to discussions on issues, evangelize socially valuable projects that deserve more attention.

# Fellows Project

We see a lot of success stories ... amongst those success stories, we wonder where the opportunities for improvement are.

* Thiel Fellowship -- could the projects conducted under these fellowships be more ~crowdly~ in nature? Is there anything magic about this particular age, ie what about people re-inventing themselves?  
* yCombinator -- what would be necessary to pour gas this notion?  Could we broaden yCombinator to an ENERGY focus?
* Nedspace -- could this model be extended to other cities -- to make it YMCA-like?
* YearOfTheStartUp (YOTSU) -- could we include more people in this program by keeping the tenure of participation in the program the same, but making the tenure of residency shorter?  What about weekend programs for entrepreneurs with jobs?
* MakerFaire -- can MakerFaires be mobilize
* Hackathon -- how do we conserve momentum?  What can we do to better "deal flow" the winners of these events into collaborative workspaces, accelerators, angel funds.
