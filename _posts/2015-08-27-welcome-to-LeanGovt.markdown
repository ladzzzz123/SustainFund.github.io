[“What if we take the relationships and connections in OUR data and reimagined OUR business along those relationships? What would that look like?”](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/a/graph-databases-2nd/337963/)  Indeed!  And what if government were aimed at staying OUT of the way of dictating morality and being the primary party in everyone's relationships and instead ONLY focused on prizing the liberties and maintaining the rights of individuals.

[LeanGovt](http://LeanGovt.ORG) takes this "What If" question a step further by asking "How can practically construct an evolving knowledge database of business connections or relational ties so that government ONLY safegaurds rights and liberties, but allows for citizens to govern themselves and govern their relationships in a fair, open, transparent equitable manner? **How can we allow citizens to exercise greater control over their lives?**"
